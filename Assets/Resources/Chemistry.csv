Chemistry,1,"Compounds that are capable of accepting electrons, such as O2 or F2, are called what?",Residues,Antioxidants,Oxygen,Oxidants,4,"Oxidants and Reductants Compounds that are capable of accepting electrons, such as O 2 or F2, are calledoxidants (or oxidizing agents) because they can oxidize other compounds. In the process of accepting electrons, an oxidant is reduced. Compounds that are capable of donating electrons, such as sodium metal or cyclohexane (C6H12), are calledreductants (or reducing agents) because they can cause the reduction of another compound. In the process of donating electrons, a reductant is oxidized. These relationships are summarized in Equation 3.30: Equation 3.30 Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books."
Chemistry,2,What kind of viscosity is found in long-chain hydrocarbons?,Intense Viscosity,Increased Viscosity,Low Viscosity,Highly Viscous,4,"There is also a correlation between viscosity and molecular shape. Liquids consisting of long, flexible molecules tend to have higher viscosities than those composed of more spherical or shorter-chain molecules. The longer the molecules, the easier it is for them to become â€œtangledâ€ with one another, making it more difficult for them to move past one another. London dispersion forces also increase with chain length. Due to a combination of these two effects, long-chain hydrocarbons (such as motor oils) are highly viscous."
Chemistry,3,Ionic compounds have strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in this?,Occasional Array,Incorrect Array,Normal Array,Regular Array,4,"Ionic compounds have strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in a regular array. The lattice energy (U) of an ionic substance is defined as the energy required to dissociate the solid into gaseous ions; U can be calculated from the charges on the ions, the arrangement of the ions in the solid, and the internuclear distance. Because U depends on the product of the ionic charges, substances with dior tripositive cations and/or di- or trinegative anions tend to have higher lattice energies than their singly charged counterparts. Higher lattice energies typically result in higher melting points and increased hardnessbecause more thermal energy is needed to overcome the forces that hold the ions together. Lattice energies cannot be measured directly but are obtained from a thermochemical cycle called the Bornâ€“Haber cycle, in which Hessâ€™s law is used to calculate the lattice energy from the measured enthalpy of formation of the ionic compound, along with other thermochemical data. The Bornâ€“Haber cycle can be used to predict which ionic compounds are likely to form. Sublimation, the conversion of a solid directly to a gas, has an accompanying enthalpy change called the enthalpy of sublimation."
Chemistry,4,How does a neon light produce visible light?,Mitosis,Luminescence,Radiation,Electroluminescence,4,"A neon light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb is a glass tube that contains the noble gas neon. When electricity passes through the gas, it excites electrons of neon atoms, causing them to give off visible light. Neon produces red light. Other noble gases are also used in lights, and they produce light of different colors. For example, krypton produces violet light, and argon produces blue light."
Chemistry,5,What term means the amount of water vapor in the air?,Ambient,Temperature,Pressure,Humidity,4,Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation.

Chemistry,8,The strength of a base depends on the concentration of _______ it produces when dissolved in water. ,Monoxide Ions,Combustion Ions,Calcium Ions,Hydroxide Ions,4,"The strength of a base depends on the concentration of hydroxide ions it produces when dissolved in water. For example, sodium hydroxide completely breaks down into ions in water, so it is a strong base. However, only a fraction of ammonia breaks down into ions, so it is a weak base."

Chemistry,10,What type of bonds are formed by the side-to-side overlap of p orbitals?,Theta Bonds,Sigma Bonds,Omega Bonds,Pi Bonds,4,Sigma bonds are formed by the end-to-end overlap of bonding orbitals. Pi bonds are formed by the side-to-side overlap of p orbitals. Single bonds are normally sigma bonds. A double or triple bond consists of one sigma bond and either one or two pi bonds.
Chemistry,11,The temperature at which a substance melts is called its ______ point. ,Freezing,Boiling,Change,Melting,4,"The temperature at which a substance melts is called its melting point. Melting point is a physical property of matter. The gold pictured in the Figure above , for example, has a melting point of 1064Â°C. This is a high melting point, and most other metals also have high melting points. The melting point of ice, in comparison, is much lower at 0Â°C. Many substances have even lower melting points. For example, the melting point of oxygen is -222Â°C."
Chemistry,12,"When equal amounts of a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid are mixed with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, the result is what kind of solution?",A Thermodynamic One,A Economical One,A Lateral One,A Neutral One,4,"When equal amounts of a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid are mixed with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, the result is a neutral solution. The products of the reaction do not have the characteristics of either an acid or a base. Here is the balanced molecular equation."
Chemistry,13,What is the electrode at which oxidation occurs called? ,Calomel,Diode,Cathode,The Anode,4,"The electrode at which oxidation occurs is called the anode . The zinc anode gradually diminishes as the cell operates due to the loss of zinc metal. The zinc ion concentration in the half-cell increases. Because of the production of electrons at the anode, it is labeled as the negative electrode."
Chemistry,14,What is required to move or change matter from one state to another?,Evolution,Food,Gravity,Energy,4,"Energy provides the ability to move or change matter from one state to another (for example, from solid to liquid). Every living thing needs energy to live and grow. Your body gets its energy from food, but that is only a small part of the energy you use every day. Cooking your food takes energy, and so does keeping it cold in the refrigerator or the freezer. The same is true for heating or cooling your home. Whether you are turning on a light in the kitchen or riding in a car to school, you are using energy. Billions of people all around the world use energy, so there is a huge demand for resources to provide all of this energy. Why do we need so much energy? The main reason is that almost everything that happens on Earth involves energy."
Chemistry,15,What contains positive protons and neutral neutrons?,Epidermis,Electrons,Ions,Nucleus,4,The nucleus is at the center of the atom. It contains positive protons and neutral neutrons. Negative electrons constantly move about the nucleus.
Chemistry,16,What is natural gas predominately made up of?,Sulfur,Hydrogen,Carbon,Methane,4,Natural gas is mostly methane. Natural gas is usually found with petroleum. People prefer to burn natural gas when possible because it is relatively clean.
Chemistry,17,What unit of measurement is defined to be the number of atoms in 12g of carbon-12?,One Ohm,One Quark,One Joule,One Mole,4,"The relative scale of atomic masses in amu is also a relative scale of masses in grams. We said before that the mole is officially equal to the number of carbon atoms in exactly 12 g of carbon-12. In other words, one carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12 amu, and one mole of carbon atoms has a mass of exactly 12 grams. This relationship is true for all substances. If one atom of helium has a mass of 4.00 amu, one mole of helium atoms has a mass of 4.00 g. One molecule of water has a mass of 18.0 amu, so one mole of water molecules has a mass of 18.0 grams. Molar mass is defined as the mass of one mole of representative particles of a substance. It is expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol)."
Chemistry,18,Isotopes are named for their number of protons + _______. ,Nuclei,Isomers,Electrons,Neutrons,4,"Isotopes are named for their number of protons plus neutrons. If a carbon atom had seven neutrons, what would it be named?."
Chemistry,19,Water can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen gases by the addition of what?,Demand,Motion,Mineral,Energy,4,"Chemistry in Everyday Life Decomposition of Water / Production of Hydrogen Water consists of the elements hydrogen and oxygen combined in a 2 to 1 ratio. Water can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen gases by the addition of energy. One way to do this is with a battery or power supply, as shown in (Figure 1.15)."
Chemistry,20,"With wavelengths from 400-700 nm, what kind of light represents only a very small portion of the spectrum?",Ultraviolet Light,Invisible Light,Sunlight,Visible Light,4,The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses a very wide range of wavelengths and frequencies.

Chemistry,22,"What is the process in which when exposed to ultraviolet, some substances, such as minerals, glow in characteristic visible wavelengths? ",Pigment,Plasma,Chemical Reaction,Fluorescence,4,"When exposed to ultraviolet, some substances, such as minerals, glow in characteristic visible wavelengths, a process called fluorescence. So-called black lights emit ultraviolet to cause posters and clothing to fluoresce in the visible. Ultraviolet is also used in special microscopes to detect details smaller than those observable with longer-wavelength visible-light microscopes. Things Great and Small: A Submicroscopic View of X-Ray Production X-rays can be created in a high-voltage discharge. They are emitted in the material struck by electrons in the discharge current. There are two mechanisms by which the electrons create X-rays. The first method is illustrated in Figure 24.18. An electron is accelerated in an evacuated tube by a high positive voltage. The electron strikes a metal plate (e. , copper) and produces X-rays. Since this is a high-voltage discharge, the electron gains sufficient energy to ionize the atom."
Chemistry,23,What forms when secondary alcohols oxidize?,Electrons,Chromosomes,Ions,Ketones,4,Secondary alcohols are oxidized to form ketones.
Chemistry,24,What forms when nitrogen and sulfur oxides in air dissolve in rain?,Acid Snow,Carbon Rain,Dioxide Rain,Acid Rain,4,Acid rain forms when nitrogen and sulfur oxides in air dissolve in rain ( Figure below ). This forms nitric and sulfuric acids. Both are strong acids. Acid rain with a pH as low as 4.0 is now common in many areas. Acid fog may be even more acidic than acid rain. Fog with a pH as low as 1.7 has been recorded. Thatâ€™s the same pH as toilet bowl cleaner!.
Chemistry,25,What forms when nitrogen and oxygen combine at high temperatures?,Calcium Oxides,Hydrocarbons,Nitric Acid,Nitrogen Oxides,4,"Nitrogen oxides include nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). Nitrogen oxides form when nitrogen and oxygen combine at high temperatures. This occurs in hot exhausts from vehicles, factories, and power plants."
Chemistry,26,The Bohr Model works only for which atom?,Boron,Helium,Carbon,Hydrogen,4,The Bohr model works only for the hydrogen atom.
Chemistry,27,Approximately 20% of the atmosphere is made of which element?,Nitrogen,Hydrogen,Carbon,Oxygen,4,"Approximately 20% of the atmosphere is oxygen. This gas is essential for life. In environments where oxygen is in low supply, it can be provided from a tank. Since gases are very compressible, a large amount of oxygen can be stored in a relatively small container. When it is released, the volume expands and the pressure decreases. The gas is then available for breathing under normal pressure."
Chemistry,28,Atoms of nonmetals form molecules that are held together by what?,Dissonance Bonds,Phenotype Bonds,Magnetic Bonds,Covalent Bonds,4,Compound forms when atoms of nonmetals form molecules that are held together by covalent bonds.
Chemistry,29,Which property of diamond makes it so hard?,Carbon Bonds,Non-Covalent Bonds,Metal-Metal Bonds,Chemical Bonds,4,"Diamond is the hardest natural material known on Earth. Yet diamond is just pure carbon. What is special about this element that makes diamond so hard? Bonds. Chemical bonds. In a perfect diamond crystal, each C atom makes four connectionsâ€”bondsâ€”to four other C atoms in a three-dimensional matrix. Four is the greatest number of bonds that is commonly made by atoms, so C atoms maximize their interactions with other atoms. This threedimensional array of connections extends throughout the diamond crystal, making it essentially one large molecule. Breaking a diamond means breaking every bond at once. Also, the bonds are moderately strong. There are stronger interactions known, but the carboncarbon connection is fairly strong itself. Not only does a person have to break many connections at once, but also the bonds are strong connections from the start. There are other substances that have similar bonding arrangements as diamond does. Silicon dioxide and boron nitride have some similarities, but neither of them comes close to the ultimate hardness of diamond. How do atoms make compounds? Typically they join together in such a way that they lose their identities as elements and adopt a new identity as a compound. These joins are called chemical bonds. But how do atoms join together? Ultimately, it all comes down to electrons. Before we discuss how electrons interact, we need to introduce a tool to simply illustrate electrons in an atom."
Chemistry,30,Hydrogen atoms form only one covalent bond because they have only one have one of what to pair with it?,Water Electron,Loops Electron,Modular Electron,Valence Electron,4,Hydrogen atoms form only one covalent bond because they have only one valence electron to pair.
Chemistry,31,The ionic end of a detergent can either be a sulfate or what?,Phosphate,Molecule,Calcite,Sulfonate,4,Figure 11.33 Detergents contain a nonpolar hydrocarbon end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end can be either a sulfate or a sulfonate. The length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from detergent to detergent.
,,,,Thermal,Genetic,Physical,4,"Any time the physical properties of a substance are changed, we can say the substance has undergone a physical change . All substances undergo physical changes where there is a change in the form of the substance but not in its chemical composition. For instance, the grinding of granular sugar into powdered sugar is a physical change. Similarly, dissolving sugar in water is a physical change. We can also use physical changes to separate mixtures into their components. There are a variety of methods used, and the best procedure depends largely on the nature of the mixture. Depending on the states of matter involved, the relative sizes of the mixtures components, and whether the mixture is homogeneous or heterogeneous will determine the necessary separation technique."
,,,,Calcites,Lead,Fullerenes,4,"Pure carbon can exist in different forms, depending on how its atoms are arranged. The forms include diamond, graphite, and fullerenes. All three forms exist as crystals, but they have different structures. Their different structures, in turn, give them different properties. You can learn more about them in Table below ."
,,,,Pressures In Nuclei,Destruction Of Nuclei,Changes In Nuclei,4,"You probably associate the term decay with images like the one above. But when it comes to atoms, decay has a different meaning. Decay in chemistry refers to changes in the nuclei of certain atoms."
,,,,It Patterns It,It Is Unchanged,It Increases It,4,"When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage."
,,,,Neutrons And Electrons,Cells And Electrons,Protons And Electrons,4,"All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and electrons, but they may vary in their numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes."
,,,,Harmonic Compound,Magnetic Compound,Ionic Compound,4,The lattice energy is usually the most important energy factor in determining the stability of an ionic compound.
,,,,Surface Energy,Membrane Energy,Activation Energy,4,"All chemical reactions, including exothermic reactions, need activation energy to get started."
,,,,Occurs,Changes,Increases,4,The acceleration of the car is in the same direction as the velocity.
,,,,Impoundment,Compass,Electromagnet,4,"Solenoids are the basis of electromagnets. An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material (see Figure below ). The electromagnetic field of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar by aligning its magnetic domains. The combined magnetic force of the magnetized iron bar and the wire coil makes an electromagnet very strong. In fact, electromagnets are the strongest magnets made. Some of them are strong enough to lift a train. The maglev train described earlier, in the lesson ""Electricity and Magnetism,"" contains permanent magnets. Strong electromagnets in the track repel the train magnets, causing the train to levitate above the track."
,,,,Minute,Hour,Second,4,"Enzymes are extremely efficient in speeding up biochemical reactions. They can catalyze up to several million reactions per second. As a result, the difference in rates of biochemical reactions with and without enzymes may be enormous. A typical biochemical reaction might take hours or even days to occur under normal cellular conditions without an enzyme, but less than a second with the enzyme."
,,,,Ions,Protons,Neurons,4,"While there are many defined neuron cell subtypes, neurons are broadly divided into four basic types: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar. Figure 35.5 illustrates these four basic neuron types. Unipolar neurons have only one structure that extends away from the soma. These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands. A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. An example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. Each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but only one axon. Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells. A pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a bipolar cell. Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions: one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord."
,,,,Shell,Ionic,Valence,4,All of the elements in group 9 have nine valence electrons.
,,,,Ionic Bond,Metallic Yield,Metallic Bond,4,"A metallic bond is the force of attraction between a positively charged metal ion and the valence electrons it shares with other ions of the metal. The electrons move freely around the positive ions, which form a lattice-like structure."
,,,,Similar State Of Solute,Gas State Of Solute,Chemical State Of Solute,4,"The properties of a solution are different from those of either the pure solute(s) or solvent. Many solution properties are dependent upon the chemical identity of the solute. Compared to pure water, a solution of hydrogen chloride is more acidic, a solution of ammonia is more basic, a solution of sodium chloride is more dense, and a solution of sucrose is more viscous. There are a few solution properties, however, that depend only upon the total concentration of solute species, regardless of their identities. These colligative properties include vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure. This small set of properties is of central importance to many natural phenomena and technological applications, as will be described in this module."
,,,,Nitrogen,Calcium,Oxygen,4,"Halogens (Cl, Br, I) have negative oxidation numbers when they form halide compounds. When combined with oxygen, they have positive numbers. In the chlorate ion (ClO 3 - ), the oxidation number of Cl +5, and the oxidation number of O is -2."
,,,,A Transition,Concentrate,A Solution,4,A solution forms when one substance dissolves in another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance that dissolves it is called the solvent.
,,,,4,6,3,4,"Water, like carbon, has a special role in living things. It is needed by all known forms of life. Water is a simple molecule, containing just three atoms. Nonetheless, waterâ€™s structure gives it unique properties that help explain why it is vital to all living organisms."
,,,,Link,Structure,Solution,4,"Imagine you have a cup that has 100ml water, and you add 15g of table sugar to the water. The sugar dissolves and the mixture that is now in the cup is made up of a solute (the sugar) that is dissolved in the solvent (the water). The mixture of a solute in a solvent is called a solution ."
,,,,Matter,Mass,Element,4,All minerals have a definite chemical makeup. A few minerals are made of only one kind of element. Silver is a mineral made only of silver atoms. Diamond and graphite are both made only of the element carbon.
,,,,Ions,Molecules,Atoms,4,"Summary 2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory The ancient Greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. During any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. 2.2 Evolution of Atomic Theory Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. Thomsonâ€™s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric chargeâ€”the charge of an electron. Rutherfordâ€™s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. Soddy demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes. 2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly 1 of the mass of 12 a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 Ã— 10âˆ’24 g. Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1âˆ’ and a mass of 0.00055 amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is the property that defines an atomâ€™s elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number."
,,,,Carbon,Liquid,Plasma,4,"Can you guess what this picture shows? The purple and blue ""flames"" are matter in a particular state. Youâ€™re probably familiar with the states of matter most common on Earth â€” solids, liquids, and gases. But these ""flames"" are a state of matter called plasma. This plasma ball was made by humans. Plasma also occurs in nature. In fact, plasma makes up most of the matter in the universe."
,,,,Gravity,Gases,Fluid,4,"14.4 Heat Transfer Methods Equally as interesting as the effects of heat transfer on a system are the methods by which this occurs. Whenever there is a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. Heat transfer may occur rapidly, such as through a cooking pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of a picnic ice chest. We can control rates of heat transfer by choosing materials (such as thick wool clothing for the winter), controlling air movement (such as the use of weather stripping around doors), or by choice of color (such as a white roof to reflect summer sunlight). So many processes involve heat transfer, so that it is hard to imagine a situation where no heat transfer occurs. Yet every process involving heat transfer takes place by only three methods: 1. Conduction is heat transfer through stationary matter by physical contact. (The matter is stationary on a macroscopic scaleâ€”we know there is thermal motion of the atoms and molecules at any temperature above absolute zero. ) Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction. Convection is the heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of a fluid. This type of transfer takes place in a forced-air furnace and in weather systems, for example. Heat transfer by radiation occurs when microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, or another form of electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. An obvious example is the warming of the Earth by the Sun. A less obvious example is thermal radiation from the human body."
,,,,Thermal,Internal,Physical,4,"The components of a mixture keep their own identity when they combine, so they retain their physical properties. Examples of physical properties include boiling point, ability to dissolve, and particle size. When components of mixtures vary in physical properties such as these, processes such as boiling, dissolving, or filtering can be used to separate them."
,,,,Biochemical,Endotropic,Exothermic,4,"Thermodynamic spontaneity. The highly exothermic and dramatic thermite reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous. Reactants of aluminum and a metal oxide, usually iron, which are stable at room temperature, are ignited either in the presence of heat or by the reaction of potassium permanganate and glycerin. The resulting products are aluminum oxide, free and molten elemental metal, and a great deal of heat, which makes this an excellent method for on-site welding. Because this reaction has its own oxygen supply, it can be used for underwater welding as well."
,,,,Neutrons,Quarks,Protons,4,"Atomic Number and Mass Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons determines an elementâ€™s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. Together, the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an elementâ€™s mass number, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number. Since an elementâ€™s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the atomic mass, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons)."
,,,,Density,Saturated Fat,Dissolved Solute,4,"There are cultures that have no numbers above three. Anything greater than that is simply referred to as â€œmuchâ€ or â€œmanyâ€. We recognize how limited this form of calculation is, but we do some of the same thing. There are several ways to express the amount of solute in a solution in a quantitative manner. The concentration of a solution is a measure of the amount of solute that has been dissolved in a given amount of solvent or solution. A concentrated solution is one that has a relatively large amount of dissolved solute. A dilute solution is one that has a relatively small amount of dissolved solute. However, those terms are vague and we need to be able to express concentration with numbers."
,,,,Oxygen,Hydrogen,Heat,4,"Another important example of the combination of phase change and convection occurs when water evaporates from the oceans. Heat is removed from the ocean when water evaporates. If the water vapor condenses in liquid droplets as clouds form, heat is released in the atmosphere. Thus, there is an overall transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. This process is the driving power behind thunderheads, those great cumulus clouds that rise as much as 20.0 km into the stratosphere. Water vapor carried in by convection condenses, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. This energy causes the air to expand and rise, where it is colder. More condensation occurs in these colder regions, which in turn drives the cloud even higher. Such a mechanism is called positive feedback, since the process reinforces and accelerates itself. These systems sometimes produce violent storms, with lightning and hail, and constitute the mechanism driving hurricanes."
,,,,Friction,Energy,Pressure,4,An increase in the number of gas molecules in the same volume container increases pressure.
,,,,Three,Six,Two,4,"There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms. The two types are illustrated in Figure 8.29. The in-phase combination produces a lower energy Ïƒs molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s"") in which most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher energy molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s-star"") molecular orbital in which there is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding orbital. Electrons in a Ïƒs orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the Ïƒ*s orbitals are located well away from the region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill higher-energy atomic orbitals."
,,,,Smelling Salts,Antacid,Aspirin,4,"Salicylic acid is used in the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. One gram dissolves in 460 mL of water to create a saturated solution with a pH of 2.40."
,,,,Fats,Proteins,Hydrocarbons,4,Hydrocarbons are molecules made of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms.
,,,,Electrons,Neutrons,Protons,4,"All protons are identical. For example, hydrogen protons are exactly the same as protons of helium and all other elements, or pure substances. However, atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons. In fact, atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that is different from the numbers of protons of all other elements. For example, a hydrogen atom has just one proton, whereas a helium atom has two protons. The number of protons in an atom determines the electrical charge of the nucleus. The nucleus also contains neutrons, but they are neutral in charge. The one proton in a hydrogen nucleus, for example, gives it a charge of +1, and the two protons in a helium nucleus give it a charge of +2.

,,,,Reaction,Diffusion,Fission,4,"Nuclear fission reactions involve collision of a slow neuron with an element, usually uranium. The products of a fission reaction are two smaller isotopes, more neutrons, and heat energy."
,,,,Particles,Gas,Solvent,4,"A solution forms when one substance dissolves in another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute . The substance it dissolves in is called the solvent . For example, ocean water is a solution in which the solute is salt and the solvent is water. In this example, a solid (salt) is dissolved in a liquid (water). However, matter in any state can be the solute or solvent in a solution. Solutions may be gases, liquids, or solids. In Table below and the video at the URL below, you can learn about solutions involving other states of matter."
,,,,Water,A Cup,A Base,4,"Acids can further be categorized based on how many acidic hydrogen atoms they contain. Acidic hydrogen atoms are those which will be transferred to a base. A monoprotic acid has only one acidic hydrogen that would be transferred to a strong base, whereas a polyprotic acid has two or more. Common monoprotic acids include HCl, HBr, and HNO 3 . A common diprotic acid is sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), and phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 ) provides an example of a triprotic acid. In each case, all hydrogens are available to participate in acid-base reactions. However, that is not the case for all acidic molecules. For example, in acetic acid (CH 3 COOH), only the hydrogen bonded to the oxygen atom is acidic. The other three hydrogens are covalently bonded to carbon and cannot be removed by any of the bases that we will consider in this chapter."
,,,,Segments,Compounds,Elements,4,"Matter is made up of a mixture of things called elements. Elements are substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. There are more than 100 known elements, and 92 occur naturally around us. The others have been made only in the laboratory."
,,,,Sulfuric Reactions,Endothermic Reactions,Exothermic Reactions,4,"Some chemical reactions are exothermic, which means they release energy. Other chemical reactions are endothermic, which means they consume energy."
,,,,Speciation,Amplification,Sublimation,4,"(a) Sublimation is the conversion of a solid (relatively high density) to a gas (much lesser density). This process yields a much greater dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much greater volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). This process yields a much lesser dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much lesser volume after the solid-to-gas transition. (c) The process in question is dilution. The food dye molecules initially occupy a much smaller volume (the drop of dye solution) than they occupy once the process is complete (in the full glass of water). The process therefore entails a greater dispersal of matter. The process may also yield a more uniform dispersal of matter, since the initial state of the system involves two regions of different dye concentrations (high in the drop, zero in the water), and the final state of the system contains a single dye concentration throughout."
,,,,Noble Gases,Metalloids,Radioactive Elements,4,"Some elements naturally change into different elements. To understand how this happens, first recall what an element is. An element is a unique substance, with a unique number of protons in the nucleus of its atoms. No two elements have the same number of protons. For example, carbon atoms always have six protons. If an atom has a different number of protons, it isnâ€™t carbon. For an element to change into a different element, then, it must change the number of protons in the nucleus of its atoms. This happens only in radioactive elements."
,,,,Extracts,Pollutants,Compounds,4,"Elements are represented by chemical symbols. Examples are H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Compounds are represented by chemical formulas . Youâ€™ve already seen the chemical formula for water. Itâ€™s H 2 O. The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen in a molecule of water. The O for oxygen has no subscript. When there is just one atom of an element in a molecule, no subscript is used. Table below shows some other examples of compounds and their chemical formulas."
,,,,Vaporization,Deposition,Sublimation,4,"Sublimation is the transition from solid to vapor phase. You may have noticed that snow can disappear into thin air without a trace of liquid water, or the disappearance of ice cubes in a freezer. The reverse is also true: Frost can form on very cold windows without going through the liquid stage. A popular effect is the making of â€œsmokeâ€ from dry ice, which is solid carbon dioxide. Sublimation occurs because the equilibrium vapor pressure of solids is not zero. Certain air fresheners use the sublimation of a solid to inject a perfume into the room. Moth balls are a slightly toxic example of a phenol (an organic compound) that sublimates, while some solids, such as osmium tetroxide, are so toxic that they must be kept in sealed containers to prevent human exposure to their sublimation-produced vapors."
,,,,Temperature Variation,Specific Gravity,Specific Heat,4,"When heat flows into an object, its thermal energy increases and so does its temperature. The amount of temperature increase depends on three things: 1) how much heat was added, 2) the size of the object, and 3) the material of which the object is made. When you add the same amount of heat to the same mass of different substances, the amount of temperature increase is different. Each substance has a specific heat, which is the amount of heat necessary to raise one mass unit of that substance by one temperature unit."
,,,,Metals And Carbonates,Metals And Freshwaters,Metals And Nonmetals,4,"Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals. Thatâ€™s because metals â€œwantâ€ to give up electrons, and nonmetals â€œwantâ€ to gain electrons."
,,,,Temperature,Mass,Energy,4,"The number of molecular orbitals produced is the same as the number of atomic orbitals used to create them (the law of conservation of orbitals). As the overlap between two atomic orbitals increases, the difference in energy between the resulting bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals increases. When two atomic orbitals combine to form a pair of molecular orbitals, the bonding molecular orbital is stabilized about as much as the antibonding molecular orbital is destabilized. The interaction between atomic orbitals is greatest when they have the same energy."
,,,,Consumers,Catalysts,Products,4,"All chemical reactions involve both reactants and products. Reactants are substances that start a chemical reaction, and products are substances that are produced in the reaction."
,,,,Enzyme,Catalyst,Base,4,"Bases are used for a variety of purposes. For example, soaps contain bases such as potassium hydroxide (KOH). Other uses of bases can be seen in the Figure below ."
,,,,Wind,Electricity,Light,4,One of the most important series of endothermic reactions is photosynthesis. The energy needed for photosynthesis comes from light.
,,,,Vaporizing,Boiling,Melting,4,
,,,,Homeostasis,Saturation,Ph,4,"The simplest situation is a salt formed by combining a strong acid and a strong base. These salts are neither acidic nor basic, so they do not affect the pH of the solution when dissolved in water. For example, the ionic compound NaNO 3 could be prepared by combining the strong acid HNO 3 and the strong base NaOH. If we were to dissolve NaNO 3 in water, it would dissociate into Na + and NO 3 - ions. Neither ion is a strong enough acid or base to cause any noticeable proton transfers, so the pH of the pure water is not altered."
,,,,Balance,Liquid,Equilibrium,4,"can continue indefinitely. In contrast, the expansion of a gas into a vacuum (Pext = 0) is irreversible because the external pressure is measurably less than the internal pressure of the gas. No equilibrium states exist, and the gas expands irreversibly. When gas escapes from a microscopic hole in a balloon into a vacuum, for example, the process is irreversible; the direction of airflow cannot change. Because work done during the expansion of a gas depends on the opposing external pressure (w = PextÎ”V), work done in a reversible process is always equal to or greater than work done in a corresponding irreversible process: wrev â‰¥ wirrev. Whether a process is reversible or irreversible, Î”E = q + w. Because E is a state function, the magnitude of Î”E does not depend on reversibility and is independent of the path taken. So Equation 18.14."
,,,,They Are Unchanged,They Are Equal,They Are Lower,4,"When gas molecules are warm, they move vigorously. They take up more space. Air density and air pressure are lower."
,,,,Plasma,Neutron,Gamma,4,"Sources of gamma rays include radioactive atoms, nuclear explosions, and stars. Gamma rays from space are absorbed by Earthâ€™s atmosphere."
,,,,Sodium And Solvent,Solute And Cytosol,Solute And Solvent,4,"All solutions have two parts: the solute and the solvent. The solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute. Particles of solvent pull apart particles of solute, and the solute particles spread throughout the solvent. Salt water, such as the ocean water in the Figure below , is an example of a solution. In a saltwater solution, salt is the solute and water is the solvent."
,,,,Density,Protons,Electrons,4,"In the course of this reaction, electrons are shifted away from each hydrogen atom and towards the oxygen atom. The hydrogen is oxidized because it undergoes a partial loss of electrons. Even though the loss is not complete enough to form ions, the hydrogen atoms in water have less electron density near them than they did in the H 2 molecule. The oxygen is reduced because it undergoes a partial gain of electrons. The oxygen atom in water has greater electron density near it than they did in the O 2 molecule."
,,,,Magnetic Process,Oxidized Process,Exothermic Process,4,"Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A change that releases heat is called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic processâ€”this process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torchâ€™s flame (Figure 5.7). A reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic process. A cold pack used to treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold."
,,,,Chemistry,Biology,Alchemy,4,"Alchemy was a somewhat mystical and secretive approach to learning how to manipulate matter. Practitioners, called alchemists, thought that all matter was composed of different proportions of the four basic elementsâ€”fire, water, earth, and airâ€”and believed that if you changed the relative proportions of these elements in a substance, you could change the substance. The long-standing attempts to â€œtransmuteâ€ common metals into gold represented one goal of alchemy. Alchemyâ€™s other major goal was to synthesize the philosopherâ€™s stone, a material that could impart long lifeâ€”even immortality. Alchemists used symbols to represent substances, some of which are shown in the accompanying figure. This was not done to better communicate ideas, as chemists do today, but to maintain the secrecy of alchemical knowledge, keeping others from sharing in it."
,,,,Reactions,Organisms,Isotopes,4,"The first plants were probably similar to the stoneworts in Figure below . Stoneworts are green algae. Like stoneworts, the first plants were aquatic. They may have had stalks but not stems. They also may have had hair-like structures called rhizoids but not roots. The first plants probably had male and female reproductive organs and needed water to reproduce. In stoneworts, sperm need at least a thin film of moisture to swim to eggs."
,,,,Water,Yeast,Solvent,4,"Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, we can achieve a particular concentration. For example, commercial pesticides are typically sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must be diluted. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of common laboratory reagents (Figure 3.17)."
,,,,Magnetism,Electrical Attraction,Radioactivity,4,"Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from its nucleus. The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation . Only unstable nuclei emit radiation. They are unstable because they have too much energy, too many protons, or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. For example, all elements with more than 83 protonsâ€”such as uranium, radium, and poloniumâ€”have unstable nuclei. They are called radioactive elements. The nuclei of these elements must lose protons to become more stable. When they do, they become different elements."
,,,,Newton'S Model,Kinetic Model,Bohr Model,4,"According to the Bohr model, often referred to as a planetary model , the electrons encircle the nucleus of the atom in specific allowable paths called orbits. When the electron is in one of these orbits, its energy is fixed. The ground state of the hydrogen atom, where its energy is lowest, is when the electron is in the orbit that is closest to the nucleus. The orbits that are further from the nucleus are all of successively greater energy. The electron is not allowed to occupy any of the spaces in between the orbits. An everyday analogy to the Bohr model is the rungs of a ladder. As you move up or down a ladder, you can only occupy specific rungs and cannot be in the spaces in between rungs. Moving up the ladder increases your potential energy, while moving down the ladder decreases your energy."
,,,,Force,Weight,Light,4,"Under the right conditions, light can be used to eject electrons from a solid material."
,,,,Fission Bond,Covalent Bond,Hydrogen Bond,4,"Opposites attract when it comes to charged molecules. In the case of water, the positive (hydrogen) end of one water molecule is attracted to the negative (oxygen) end of a nearby water molecule. Because of this attraction, weak bonds form between adjacent water molecules, as shown in Figure below . The type of bond that forms between molecules is called a hydrogen bond . Bonds between molecules are not as strong as bonds within molecules, but in water they are strong enough to hold together nearby molecules."
,,,,Oxygen,Helium,Carbon,4,"Carbon has the ability to form very long chains of interconnecting C-C bonds. This property allows carbon to form the backbone of organic compounds , carbon-containing compounds, which are the basis of all known organic life. Nearly 10 million carbon-containing organic compounds are known. Types of carbon compounds in organisms include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The elements found in each type are listed in the table below. Elements other than carbon and hydrogen usually occur within organic compounds in smaller groups of elements called functional groups . When organic compounds react with other compounds, generally just the functional groups are involved. Therefore, functional groups generally determine the nature and functions of organic compounds."
,,,,Isotopes,Negative Charges,Actual Charges,4,"Calculating Formal Charge The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure. Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows: formal charge = # valence shell electrons (free atom) âˆ’ # lone pair electrons âˆ’ 1 # bonding electrons 2 We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion. We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges."
