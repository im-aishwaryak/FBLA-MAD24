# Snowpeak Secrets

**Snowpeak Secrets** is a cross-platform mobile application designed to revolutionize learning by gamifying education across a wide range of subjects. Targeting older elementary to high school students who may struggle to find motivation in traditional learning environments, the app fosters creativity, curiosity, and engagement through interactive and immersive gameplay. Built using **Unity** for game development and **Firebase** for backend services, Snowpeak Secrets combines cutting-edge technology with carefully crafted educational content.

## **The Core Premise**

The game introduces players to Sammi, a spirited young explorer who stumbles upon **Edgel Wonk Peak**, a mysterious mountain filled with untold secrets and opportunities. Driven by a desire to learn outside conventional methods, Sammi leaves behind the confines of traditional schooling to pursue her imagination and interests, such as art, history, and exploration. To sustain herself on the mountain, Sammi sets up a shop for tourists, crafting potions from items she collects during nightly explorations. Players take on Sammi's role, balancing shop management with the thrill of adventure.

## **Key Gameplay Elements**

1. **Exploration**: Players guide Sammi as she explores the mountain at night, facing challenges and collecting valuable items.
2. **Education Integration**: To progress along trails on the mountain, players must correctly answer a series of subject-based questions. Each "trail" represents a lesson, broken into smaller "checkpoints" that serve as subsections.
    - Completing checkpoints unlocks increasingly rare and high-value items for Sammiâ€™s shop.
    - The lessons are seamlessly tied to the exploration gameplay, making learning part of the adventure.
3. **Shop Management**: During the day, players help Sammi prepare orders and sell potions crafted from items found on the mountain. Earnings are used to cover her living expenses and purchase upgrades.
4. **Skill-Building**: Beyond subject knowledge, the game hones practical skills such as:
    - **Motor Skills**: Through fast-paced item collection and obstacle avoidance.
    - **Strategic Thinking**: Maximizing shop profits and resource management.
    - **Ingredient Tracking**: Keeping tabs on inventory and crafting resources.

## **Balance of Gameplay Styles**

Snowpeak Secrets appeals to a broad audience by combining the excitement of fast-paced gaming with the serenity of a creative, story-driven experience. The game avoids gender-specific targeting, ensuring it resonates with players of all demographics.

## **Target Audience and Goals**

The app aims to inspire learners of all ages, particularly those who face barriers to motivation in traditional settings. It seeks to provide an accessible, engaging platform for building subject knowledge and supplemental skills. Credible research on gamification supports its ability to make learning enjoyable and immersive.
